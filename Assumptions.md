## System Architecture

### 1. Technology Stack Choice

**Assumption:** Java 21 with Spring Boot 4.0.1 was chosen

**Rationale:**
- **Enterprise Ready:** Spring Boot is the industry standard for enterprise Java applications
- **Java 21 LTS:** Latest Long-Term Support Java version with virtual threads and modern features
- **Mature Ecosystem:** Comprehensive libraries and tools for all common requirements
- **Performance:** Excellent performance with JVM optimizations and virtual threads
- **Type Safety:** Strong static typing catches errors at compile time
- **Developer Experience:** Spring Boot auto-configuration, excellent IDE support, comprehensive documentation
- **Job Market:** High demand for Spring Boot developers in enterprise environments

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ Enterprise-grade reliability and scalability
- ✓ Strong type safety and compile-time validation
- ✓ Extensive ecosystem (Spring Data, Spring Security 6.x, etc.)
- ✓ Excellent tooling and IDE support
- ✓ Virtual threads in Java 21 for better concurrency
- ✗ More verbose than some modern frameworks
- ✗ Longer startup time compared to lightweight frameworks (mitigated with GraalVM in future)

### 2. Database Choice: PostgreSQL

**Assumption:** PostgreSQL was chosen for data storage

**Rationale:**
- **ACID Compliance:** Critical for borrowing transactions (prevent double-borrowing)
- **Relational Model:** Natural fit for library domain (users, books, borrows)
- **Concurrent Access:** Excellent handling of multiple simultaneous borrows/returns
- **Mature Technology:** Proven reliability, extensive documentation
- **JSON Support:** Flexibility for future features (metadata, tags, etc.)
- **Open Source:** No licensing costs, community support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- MongoDB: Not suitable for transactional guarantees needed
- MySQL: Similar to PostgreSQL but weaker JSON support
- SQLite: Not suitable for production concurrent access

### 3. ORM Choice: Hibernate 6.x (JPA 3.1)

**Assumption:** Hibernate 6.x/JPA 3.1 with Spring Data JPA was chosen for database access

**Rationale:**
- **Industry Standard:** JPA is the standard Java persistence API
- **Hibernate 6.x:** Modern version with performance improvements and Java 21 support
- **Feature Rich:** Advanced features like lazy loading, second-level caching, transaction management
- **Type Safety:** Compile-time checking of entity mappings with Jakarta Persistence annotations
- **Mature:** Decades of development and optimization
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies repository implementation with method name queries and Specifications API
- **Automatic Schema Management:** DDL auto-generation for development (production uses Flyway)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- JDBC: Too low-level, requires more boilerplate
- MyBatis: Less automatic mapping, more SQL writing
- jOOQ: Great for complex queries but more code-first approach

### 4. Containerization: Docker

**Assumption:** Docker is required for deployment

**Rationale:**
- **Environment Consistency:** Same behavior in dev, test, production
- **Dependency Isolation:** No system-level dependency conflicts (Java version, Maven, etc.)
- **Easy Deployment:** Single command to start entire stack
- **Multi-stage Builds:** Smaller production images with only runtime dependencies
- **Scalability:** Easy to add more API instances behind load balancer
- **CI/CD Integration:** Docker images can be built and deployed automatically

---

## User Management

### 6. User Terminology: "User" vs "Member"

**Assumption:** The system uses "User" terminology instead of "Member"

**Rationale:**
- **Flexibility:** Not all users are borrowers (librarians, admins)
- **Industry Standard:** "User" is more common in authentication systems
- **Role-Based:** User roles (member/librarian) better express capabilities
- **API Naming:** RESTful endpoints use `/users/` (standard practice)

**Note:** In documentation and API responses, members are referred to as "borrowers" when discussing the borrowing context.

### 7. User Roles: Two-Tier System

**Assumption:** System has two primary roles (Member, Librarian) + Superuser

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity:** Minimal roles reduce complexity
- **Clear Separation:** Members borrow, librarians manage
- **Extensibility:** Permission overrides allow customization without new roles
- **Superuser:** Required for initial setup and permission management

**Future Extension:** Additional roles (e.g., "restricted member", "book curator") can be added by creating permission presets.

### 8. Self-Service Borrowing Only

**Assumption:** Users can only borrow books for themselves (not on behalf of others)

**Rationale:**
- **Task Ambiguity:** "On behalf of a borrower" interpreted as self-service
- **Accountability:** Clear tracking of who borrowed what
- **Simplicity:** No need for proxy borrowing logic
- **Librarian Workflow:** If librarians need to borrow for patrons, they can:
  1. Create temporary account for patron
  2. Login as patron to borrow
  3. Or: Future feature for "assisted borrowing"

**Alternative Interpretation:** If "on behalf of" means librarian-assisted borrowing, this can be added by:
- Adding `borrower_id` parameter to borrow endpoint (optional, librarian-only)
- Allowing librarians with `borrows:create_on_behalf` permission to specify borrower

### 9. Single Role Per User

**Assumption:** Each user has exactly one role (member OR librarian)

**Rationale:**
- **Clarity:** Clear permission sets per user
- **Database Design:** Single `role` column (enum type)
- **Permission System:** Role provides base permissions, overrides handle exceptions
- **Real-World Model:** Library staff are either members or librarians, rarely both

**Override Mechanism:** If a librarian needs member-only restrictions, use permission overrides to deny specific actions.

### 10. User Full Name is Optional

**Assumption:** User's `full_name` field is optional (nullable)

**Rationale:**
- **Privacy:** Some users may prefer minimal personal information
- **Email Requirement:** Email is sufficient for authentication
- **Registration Flow:** Faster signup without forcing name entry
- **Flexibility:** Name can be added later via profile update

**Alternative:** Could be made required if library policy mandates it.

### 11. No Email Verification

**Assumption:** Email addresses are not verified (no confirmation email sent)

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Email verification not mentioned in requirements
- **Implementation:** `emails` library is present but not used
- **Future Feature:** Easy to add email verification flow later
- **Current State:** Users can immediately use their account after signup

**Security Consideration:** In production, email verification is recommended to:
- Prevent fake accounts
- Ensure password reset capability
- Verify user identity

### 12. No Password Reset Flow

**Assumption:** No "forgot password" functionality implemented

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Not mentioned in requirements
- **Complexity:** Requires email sending, token generation, expiration logic
- **Workaround:** Superusers can manually reset passwords via admin endpoint
- **Future Feature:** Can be added using `emails` library

---

## Book Management

### 13. ISBN Consistency Enforcement

**Assumption:** Books with identical ISBN must have matching title and author

**Rationale:**
- **ISBN Definition:** ISBN is a unique identifier for a specific publication
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents cataloging errors
- **Real-World Accuracy:** Reflects how ISBNs actually work
- **Query Reliability:** Users can search by ISBN and get consistent results

**Implementation:**
- Validation runs on book creation
- Searches for existing books with same ISBN
- Rejects if title/author mismatch
- Allows multiple copies with same ISBN (different book IDs)

**Edge Case:** Different editions (e.g., hardcover vs paperback) have different ISBNs, so this is handled correctly.

### 14. Multiple Copies Allowed

**Assumption:** Libraries can register multiple physical copies of the same book

**Rationale:**
- **Real-World Need:** Libraries own multiple copies of popular books
- **Different IDs:** Each physical copy gets a unique book ID
- **Individual Tracking:** Track which specific copy is borrowed
- **Availability:** One copy borrowed doesn't affect others

**Database Design:**
- `isbn` column is indexed but NOT unique
- Each row = one physical book copy
- `id` (UUID) is the unique identifier for each copy

**Example:**
```
id                                   isbn            title               is_available
123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 9780134685991   Pragmatic Programmer  false (borrowed)
223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001 9780134685991   Pragmatic Programmer  true  (available)
```

### 15. ISBN Format Support

**Assumption:** Both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 formats are accepted

**Rationale:**
- **Legacy Support:** Older books use ISBN-10
- **Modern Standard:** Newer books use ISBN-13
- **User Convenience:** Accept both without requiring conversion
- **Normalization:** Hyphens and spaces automatically removed

**Validation Rules:**
- ISBN-10: Exactly 10 digits (last can be 'X')
- ISBN-13: Exactly 13 digits
- Max 20 characters (allows for hyphens in input)
- Stored normalized (digits only)

### 16. No Book Categories/Genres

**Assumption:** Books don't have categories, tags, or genres

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Not mentioned in requirements
- **Simplicity:** Keep initial version minimal
- **Search:** Title and author search is sufficient for MVP
- **Future Feature:** Can add `genre`, `tags`, `categories` columns later

**Workaround:** Search by title or author to find related books.

### 17. No Book Deletion Restrictions

**Assumption:** Books can be deleted even if they have borrow history

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Deletion rules not specified
- **Current Implementation:** Books can be deleted freely
- **Data Integrity:** Foreign key constraints would prevent deletion if borrows exist

**Better Practice (Future):**
- Implement soft delete (mark as deleted, keep record)
- Prevent deletion of books with active borrows
- Allow deletion only if no borrow history exists

### 18. Book Availability is Binary

**Assumption:** Books are either available or unavailable (no "reserved", "damaged", etc.)

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity:** Binary state is easier to manage
- **Task Scope:** Only borrowing/returning mentioned
- **Implementation:** Single `is_available` boolean flag
- **Automatic Update:** Set to `false` on borrow, `true` on return

**Future Extension:** Could add status enum: available, borrowed, reserved, damaged, lost, etc.

---

## Borrowing System

### 19. No Borrow Duration/Due Dates

**Assumption:** Books can be borrowed indefinitely (no due dates or late fees)

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Duration not mentioned in requirements
- **Simplicity:** No need for date calculations, overdue notifications
- **Data Model:** `borrow_at` and `returned_at` timestamps recorded
- **Flexibility:** Easy to add duration limits later

**Future Extension:**
- Add `due_date` column
- Add `overdue_fees` calculation
- Add notification system for overdue books
- Add auto-return after extreme delays

### 20. Only Borrower Can Return

**Assumption:** Users can only return books they personally borrowed

**Rationale:**
- **Security:** Prevent unauthorized returns
- **Accountability:** Clear tracking of who had the book
- **Real-World Model:** Libraries track who returns books
- **Permission Check:** `borrower_id` must match current user

**Exception:** Librarians with `borrows:return_any` permission could be allowed to return on behalf of users (not currently implemented).

### 21. No Reservation System

**Assumption:** Books cannot be reserved in advance

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Reservation not mentioned
- **Simplicity:** First-come, first-served model
- **Current Flow:** Check availability → borrow immediately
- **Future Feature:** Add reservation queue system

**Workaround:** Users must check periodically for availability.

### 22. Complete Borrow History Retained

**Assumption:** All borrow records are kept permanently (never deleted)

**Rationale:**
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history for accountability
- **Analytics:** Future reports on borrowing patterns
- **User History:** Users can see their full borrowing history
- **Data Integrity:** Soft deletes maintain referential integrity

**Storage Consideration:** Old records could be archived after N years if needed.

### 23. No Simultaneous Borrowing Limit

**Assumption:** Users can borrow unlimited books simultaneously

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Limits not mentioned
- **Flexibility:** Different libraries have different policies
- **Implementation:** No check on number of active borrows per user
- **Future Feature:** Add `max_active_borrows` setting per role

**Easy to Add:**
```python
active_borrows = session.query(BorrowRecord).filter(
    BorrowRecord.borrower_id == user.id,
    BorrowRecord.returned_at.is_(None)
).count()
if active_borrows >= MAX_BORROWS:
    raise TooManyActiveBorrowsError()
```

### 24. No Renewal System

**Assumption:** Borrowed books cannot be renewed (extended)

**Rationale:**
- **Task Scope:** Renewal not mentioned
- **Current Flow:** Return → Re-borrow if available
- **Simplicity:** Avoid complex renewal logic
- **Future Feature:** Add renewal endpoint

**Workaround:** Return and immediately borrow again (if still available).

## Authentication & Security

### 25. JWT Token Expiration

**Assumption:** Access tokens expire after 1 hour (3600 seconds)

**Rationale:**
- **Security:** Limited window for token theft/misuse
- **Balance:** Long enough to avoid constant re-login, short enough for security
- **Configurable:** Set via `JWT_EXPIRATION` environment variable (milliseconds)
- **Token Blacklist:** Logout endpoint adds tokens to blacklist for immediate revocation
- **No Refresh Tokens:** Users must re-login after expiration (simpler implementation)

**Implementation Details:**
- JJWT 0.12.3 library for token generation/validation
- Unique JTI (token ID) for blacklist tracking
- Issuer and audience verification for additional security

**Alternative:** Could implement refresh tokens for longer sessions.

### 26. Password Requirements

**Assumption:** Passwords must meet the following requirements (configurable via application.yaml):
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehensive Security:** Multi-layer password complexity requirements
- **Bean Validation:** Custom `@ValidPassword` annotation with `PasswordValidatorImpl`
- **Configurable:** All requirements can be adjusted in `application.yaml`
- **BCrypt Hashing:** Passwords stored with BCrypt (strength 12) for maximum security
- **Industry Standard:** Meets most enterprise password policies

**Implementation:**
- Custom validator class: `PasswordValidatorImpl`
- Pattern matching for character requirements
- Clear error messages for each validation failure

**Future Enhancement:** Add optional password strength indicator (client-side).

### 27. Brute-Force Protection with Account Lockout

**Assumption:** Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts for 15 minutes

**Rationale:**
- **Security First:** Protects against brute-force password attacks
- **In-Memory Tracking:** Uses Caffeine cache to track failed attempts per email
- **Configurable:** Max attempts and lockout duration set in `application.yaml`
- **Automatic Unlock:** Cache expiration automatically unlocks after timeout
- **No Database Impact:** Failed attempt tracking doesn't write to database

**Implementation:**
- `LoginAttemptService` with Caffeine in-memory cache
- Per-email attempt tracking (not per IP to handle shared IPs)
- Clear error message: "Account locked due to too many failed login attempts"
- Counter resets on successful login

**Configuration:**
```yaml
application.security.brute-force:
  max-attempts: 5
  lockout-duration-minutes: 15
```

**Protection Layers:**
1. Rate limiting: 5 requests/minute per IP (Bucket4j)
2. Brute-force protection: 5 attempts/email then 15-min lockout (Caffeine)
3. JWT validation: Prevents token reuse and tampering

### 28. Initial Data Seeding

**Assumption:** Initial permissions, roles, users and sample books are created automatically on startup

**Rationale:**
- **Bootstrap Problem:** Need initial data structure and users to start using the system
- **ApplicationRunner:** `DataInitializer` implements `ApplicationRunner` to seed database on startup
- **Environment Config:** All seed credentials configured via environment variables
- **Production Safety:** Change default passwords via environment variables before deployment
- **Transactional:** All seeding operations wrapped in `@Transactional` for consistency
- **Idempotent:** Only creates data if it doesn't already exist (checks before insert)

**Seed Data Structure:**
1. **Permissions** (13 permissions): `books:*`, `borrows:*`, `users:*`, `permissions:*`
2. **Roles** (3 roles): ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, MEMBER with appropriate permission mappings
3. **Users** (3 users):
   - **Admin**: From `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_FULLNAME` env vars
   - **Librarian**: From `LIBRARIAN_EMAIL`, `LIBRARIAN_PASSWORD`, `LIBRARIAN_FULLNAME` env vars
   - **Member**: From `MEMBER_EMAIL`, `MEMBER_PASSWORD`, `MEMBER_FULLNAME` env vars
4. **Sample Books** (4 books): 2x Great Gatsby, 1984, Clean Code

**Security Warning:** Configure production credentials via environment variables before deployment. Never use default/hardcoded passwords in production.

### 29. Role-Based Access Control (No Permission Overrides Currently)

**Assumption:** Three-role system without individual permission overrides

**Current Implementation:**
- **ADMIN Role**: All permissions including `users:manage`, `permissions:manage`
- **LIBRARIAN Role**: `books:*`, `borrows:read_all`, `users:read`
- **MEMBER Role**: `books:read`, `borrows:create`, `borrows:return`, `borrows:read` (own only)

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity:** Straightforward role-based system without complexity of overrides
- **Many-to-Many Mapping:** User ↔ Role ↔ Permission with eager loading
- **Spring Security Integration:** Roles and permissions mapped to `GrantedAuthority`
- **Method-Level Security:** `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('permission:action')")` annotations

**Future Enhancement - Permission Override System:**
If needed, could add permission override table for Django/AWS IAM-style control:
- Grant `books:create` to specific member without role change
- Deny `borrows:create` to member with violations
- DENY always wins over ALLOW (security-first)

**Current Workaround:** Create additional role types if needed (e.g., SENIOR_MEMBER with extra permissions)

## API Design

### 30. RESTful API Design

**Assumption:** API follows REST principles

**Rationale:**
- **Industry Standard:** Familiar to most developers
- **HTTP Methods:** GET (read), POST (create), PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
- **Resource-Oriented:** URLs represent resources (`/books/{id}`)
- **Stateless:** Each request contains all necessary information
- **JSON Format:** Standard data interchange format

**Alternatives Considered:**
- GraphQL: Overkill for simple CRUD operations
- RPC: Less standard, harder to cache

### 31. API Versioning

**Assumption:** API is versioned with `/api/v1` prefix

**Rationale:**
- **Future-Proofing:** Can introduce `/api/v2` with breaking changes
- **Backward Compatibility:** Old clients continue working
- **Clear Contract:** Version in URL makes it explicit
- **Best Practice:** Industry-standard approach
- **Spring Boot Support:** Easy to implement with `@RequestMapping` base paths

**Migration Path:** When v2 is needed, maintain v1 for deprecation period.

### 32. Pagination Defaults

**Assumption:** Default pagination returns 100 items, max 1000

**Rationale:**
- **Performance:** Limit data transferred in single request
- **User Experience:** 100 items is reasonable default page size
- **Flexibility:** Clients can adjust with `skip` and `limit` parameters
- **Protection:** Max 1000 prevents abuse (requesting millions of records)

**Endpoints Affected:** All list endpoints (`/books/`, `/borrows/`, `/users/`)

### 33. Filtering and Sorting

**Assumption:** List endpoints support filtering and sorting

**Rationale:**
- **User Experience:** Find specific items without client-side filtering
- **Performance:** Database indexes make this efficient
- **Flexibility:** Multiple filter parameters can be combined
- **Standard Practice:** Expected behavior for list APIs

**Examples:**
- `/books/?available_only=true` - Only available books
- `/books/?search=python` - Search title/author
- `/books/?sort=-created_at` - Newest first

### 34. Error Response Format

**Assumption:** Errors return consistent JSON format with `message` or `detail` field

**Rationale:**
- **Consistency:** All errors have same structure
- **Client Parsing:** Easy to extract error message
- **Spring Boot Standard:** Follows Spring Boot exception handling patterns
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Proper codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- **Global Exception Handler:** Centralized error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Human-readable error message",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-11T12:00:00Z",
  "status": 400
}
```

### 35. Security Features

**Assumption:** Multiple security layers are implemented with Spring Security 6.x

**Rationale:**
- **JWT Authentication:** Stateless token-based authentication with JJWT 0.12.3
- **Token Blacklist:** Logout revokes tokens via `TokenBlacklist` table
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Fine-grained permission system with `@PreAuthorize`
- **Password Encryption:** BCrypt hashing (strength 12) for password storage
- **Rate Limiting:** Bucket4j token bucket algorithm (5 req/min auth, 100 req/min general)
- **Brute Force Protection:** Account lockout (5 attempts, 15-min timeout) with Caffeine cache
- **CORS Configuration:** Controlled cross-origin access from allowed origins
- **Security Headers:** CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- **Password Validation:** Custom Bean Validation for complexity requirements

**Implementation:**
- Spring Security 6.x with method-level security enabled
- Custom filters: `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `RateLimitingFilter`
- `SecurityConfig` with stateless session management
- `CustomUserDetailsService` for user/role/permission loading
- Environment-based configuration for different security profiles
- Global exception handler (`@RestControllerAdvice`) for consistent error responses

---

## Data Validation

### 36. Input Validation

**Assumption:** All request data is validated with Bean Validation (Jakarta Validation)

**Rationale:**
- **Type Safety:** Compile-time type checking with Java
- **Clear Errors:** Detailed validation error messages
- **API Documentation:** Annotations integrate with Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Security:** Prevents injection attacks, malformed data
- **Standard Annotations:** `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Pattern`, etc.

**Validation Rules:**
- Email format validation (`@Email`)
- Password length constraints (`@Size`)
- ISBN format validation (custom validators)
- UUID format for IDs (enforced by type system)
- String length limits (`@Size`) to prevent abuse

### 37. ISBN Normalization

**Assumption:** ISBNs are normalized (hyphens/spaces removed) before storage

**Rationale:**
- **Consistency:** All ISBNs stored in same format
- **Search Efficiency:** Exact match queries work reliably
- **User Flexibility:** Accept various input formats
- **Display Format:** Can be reformatted for display if needed

**Example:**
- Input: `978-0-13-468599-1`
- Stored: `9780134685991`

### 38. Field Length Limits

**Assumption:** Text fields have maximum lengths

**Rationale:**
- **Database Efficiency:** VARCHAR with limits uses less space
- **Abuse Prevention:** Prevent extremely long inputs
- **Reasonable Limits:** Chosen based on real-world use

**Limits:**
- Email: 255 chars (standard)
- Full name: 255 chars
- Book title: 500 chars (handles long academic titles)
- Book author: 255 chars (multiple authors fit)
- ISBN: 20 chars (allows hyphens in input)

---

## Performance & Scalability

### 39. Database Indexing

**Assumption:** Key columns are indexed for performance

**Rationale:**
- **Query Performance:** Fast lookups on common queries
- **Indexes Added:**
  - User email (unique index)
  - Book ISBN (non-unique index)
  - Foreign keys (automatic)

**Future Indexes:**
- Full-text search on book title/author
- Compound index on (borrower_id, returned_at)

### 40. Connection Pooling

**Assumption:** HikariCP connection pool is configured (Spring Boot 4.0.1 default)

**Rationale:**
- **Performance:** Reuse connections instead of creating new ones
- **Best-in-Class:** HikariCP is the fastest and most reliable JDBC connection pool
- **Spring Boot Default:** HikariCP is Spring Boot's default connection pool (auto-configured)
- **Resource Management:** Limit total connections to database
- **Zero-Overhead:** Extremely lightweight with minimal memory footprint

**Default Configuration (can override in application.yaml):**
```yaml
spring.datasource.hikari:
  maximum-pool-size: 15
  minimum-idle: 5
  connection-timeout: 30000  # 30 seconds
  idle-timeout: 600000       # 10 minutes
  max-lifetime: 1800000      # 30 minutes
  connection-test-query: SELECT 1  # PostgreSQL health check
```

### 41. Request Processing

**Assumption:** API uses servlet-based synchronous request handling (Spring MVC)

**Rationale:**
- **Thread-Per-Request Model:** Each request handled by dedicated thread from pool
- **Mature and Stable:** Decades of optimization and battle-testing
- **Simpler Programming Model:** Easier to reason about than async/reactive
- **Resource Efficiency:** Modern JVMs handle threads efficiently
- **Spring MVC Default:** Standard Spring Boot web approach

**Alternative Considered:**
- Spring WebFlux (reactive): More complex, beneficial mainly for I/O-heavy workloads with backpressure needs
- Current synchronous model is sufficient for typical CRUD operations

### 42. Horizontal Scaling

**Assumption:** Multiple API instances can run behind a load balancer

**Rationale:**
- **Stateless Design:** JWT tokens eliminate need for session storage
- **Shared Database:** All instances connect to same PostgreSQL
- **Docker Support:** Easy to spin up multiple containers
- **No Sticky Sessions:** Any instance can handle any request

**Scaling Options:**
- Docker Compose with replicas
- Kubernetes deployment with multiple pods
- Cloud auto-scaling groups
- Load balancers: nginx, HAProxy, cloud load balancers

---

## Testing Strategy

### 43. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Assumption:** All endpoints and business logic have automated tests

**Rationale:**
- **Quality Assurance:** Catch bugs before production
- **Refactoring Safety:** Tests ensure changes don't break functionality
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as usage examples
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing on every commit

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests: Business logic functions
- Integration tests: API endpoints with database
- Edge case tests: Error conditions, validation failures

### 44. Test Database Isolation with TestContainers

**Assumption:** Tests use isolated PostgreSQL container via TestContainers

**Rationale:**
- **Real Database:** Uses actual PostgreSQL 16-alpine, not H2 or mocks
- **Reproducibility:** Each test run starts with clean container
- **Production Parity:** Same database engine as production
- **Isolation:** Separate container for tests, no shared state
- **Auto-Cleanup:** Container disposed after test suite completes

**Implementation:**
- `BaseIntegrationTest` with static PostgreSQL container
- `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)` for full context
- `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` for MockMvc HTTP testing
- `@DynamicPropertySource` injects container connection details
- DDL auto set to `create-drop` for test profile
- Test utilities: `TestSecurityUtils` for JWT token generation

**Test Organization:**
- Integration tests: `*IT.java` (e.g., `BookControllerIT`, `BorrowControllerIT`)
- Unit tests: `*Test.java`
- Base class: `BaseIntegrationTest` with shared container setup

### 45. Testing Frameworks

**Assumption:** JUnit 5 Jupiter and Spring Boot Test 4.0.1 are used for testing

**Rationale:**
- **JUnit 5 Jupiter:** Modern testing framework with improved features (@ParameterizedTest, @DisplayName, etc.)
- **Spring Boot Test:** Comprehensive testing support for Spring applications
- **TestContainers:** Real PostgreSQL container for integration tests (production parity)
- **MockMvc:** Test REST controllers without starting actual server
- **Mockito:** Mocking framework for unit tests (included with Spring Boot Test)
- **AssertJ:** Fluent assertions for better readability (included)
- **Spring Security Test:** `@WithMockUser` and security testing utilities

**Test Categories:**
- **Integration Tests** (`*IT.java`): Full application context with TestContainers PostgreSQL
  - Uses `@SpringBootTest` with `RANDOM_PORT`
  - `MockMvc` for HTTP request/response testing
  - `TestSecurityUtils` for JWT token generation
  - Example: `BookControllerIT`, `AuthControllerIT`, `BorrowControllerIT`
- **Unit Tests** (`*Test.java`): Isolated component testing with mocks
  - Service layer logic with mocked repositories
  - Use `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`
- **Repository Tests**: `@DataJpaTest` for repository layer (if needed)

**Test Configuration:**
- `application-test.yaml`: Test-specific configuration (relaxed rate limits, test database)
- `BaseIntegrationTest`: Shared setup for all integration tests
- Test profile: `@ActiveProfiles("test")`

---

## Summary

These assumptions represent design decisions made to create a complete, production-ready library management system. While some features (email verification, due dates, reservations) were left out of the initial implementation, the architecture supports future extension.

The design prioritizes:
- ✅ **Simplicity:** Start with essential features
- ✅ **Security:** Authentication, authorization, validation
- ✅ **Reliability:** ACID transactions, error handling
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Clean code, comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Scalability:** Stateless design, caching, async operations
- ✅ **User Experience:** Clear errors, fast responses, flexible API

All assumptions can be revisited based on real-world usage and feedback.
